SECURITY AND TESTING BEST PRACTICES FOR PYTHON

SQL Injection Prevention Guidelines

Always use Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements. This is the primary defense against SQL injection. Never concatenate user input directly into a query string.

Input Validation. Validate user input to ensure it matches the expected type and format (e.g., only digits for an ID). Use allow-lists instead of block-lists.

Principle of Least Privilege. Ensure the database account used by the application has only the minimum necessary permissions.

Avoid relying solely on input sanitization functions. While sanitization is useful for display and general cleaning, it is secondary to parameterization for database interaction.

Python Security Coding Standards

Use standard library functions (json.loads, re) carefully. For sanitizing HTML, use libraries like Bleach.

Error Handling: Never expose raw database errors or stack traces to the user. Log them internally only.

Unit Testing for Security

Security tests must include unit tests for input functions to verify that known malicious input strings (' OR '1'='1) are correctly neutralized, escaped, or rejected by the sanitization function. Test boundary conditions (empty string, very long strings, Unicode).
